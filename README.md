Over the course of a single day, billions of financial transactions occur. There is an important need to keep track of all the data for the financial firms, the customers who buy and sell, and the government who needs to makes sure that everything is running by the law.

<strong>Customers:</strong>

The customer database needs to have the customer name, product name and item bought. The above is a foreign key Customer_ID. Then there is needs to be place for the customerâ€™s holding positions as well as the remaining positions.

There then needs to be a primary key with Payment Method (Payment_Method_Code). This is used to show many different banks that the customer needs to fund their account.







<strong>Financial Firms:</strong>

When a financial transaction occurs, there are least two counterparties: the multiple buyers and the multiple sellers called Customer_ID. Then there needs a place for price to make sure the amount is bought and sold is listed to the customer who did those things.




<strong>Government:</strong>

The government needs to make sure that that taxes are collected from the sale of securities. The dates of these transactions are needed to make sure that the transactions happened during the same calendar year.
